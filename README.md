## How to run the code
Once you downnload zip file and extract to listapp folder. 
Then, Open cmd and change the directory to listapp folder in cmd. 
Run 'npm install', it will download the dependencies.
Since I installed NPM, I am using 'npm install'. If you are using any other package manager(yarn) use it to install the dependencies. Ex: 'yarn install' 
If a question appears like this during installing dependencies 'Would you like to share anonymous usage data with Angular Team at Google under Google's Privacy Policy....?' Type N then continue.
Once all the dependencies download finished. 
Type 'ng serve -o' to run the source code in browser.

## Build the Code
Type 'ng build --prod' to build the code.
After you build the code dist folder will be created with builded code. 
Now copy the listapp folder from the dist folder to your local server and run it.
